# scTIGER2.0
Single-cell Temporal Inference of Gene Regulatory 2.0 (scTIGER2.0) Networks is an extension of scTIGER, a computation method of predicting gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that uses paired datasets of case versus control experiments. scTIGER2.0 can accept paired datasets and single case or control experiments to predict GRNs.
